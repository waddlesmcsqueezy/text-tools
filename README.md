# text-tools
A set of Python tools that I made for fun. Many have no real purpose but are fun to play with.

# vowel_counter
This tool will take the user's input as a string format and output the number of vowels (a, e, i, o & u) in the console.

# pig_latin
This tool will convert user input into a pig-latin word. eg; job > ob-jay (see wikipedia page for rules on pig latin)
